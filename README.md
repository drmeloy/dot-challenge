# Dot coding challenge

1. Create a react application that allows users to click the screen and leave a 10px x 10px dot

2. Create an undo button that allows the users to remove the last dot. It can be clicked as many times as needed (removing all the dots)

3. Create a redo button that puts the "undone" dots back on the screen. It can be clicked as many times as needed (restoring all the dots)
